# RotateMethod
## Overview
This is simple web project for Calculating methods subject. This project solves systems of linear equations (3x3), 
but can be easily updated for bigger dimensions: all calculating methods don't use constant dimensions, so You need only change output method (getSolution),
because one of last steps finds solution of triangle matrix (3x3).
Note that sometimes because of infelicity it does not set needed value of main matrix to zero, but lefts very small number (like 1.0031413E-16).
## Installing
I created this app in IntelliJ IDEA, using <a href="https://spring.io/guides/gs/validating-form-input/">this project</a> as template.
So to launch it - just clone it from here and open in IntelliJ IDEA. Last one makes almost everything You need (except finding a girlfriend :p).
